# Project Title

**Design & Implement an n8n Workflow to Connect Spreadsheet, Notion & GPT**

## Project Overview

Stop manually copying data between your spreadsheets, Notion, and Slack. I will build a robust **n8n automation** that watches for new rows in Google Sheets (or Typeform), uses **GPT-4** to summarize or tag the data, and instantly creates a formatted page in **Notion** while alerting your team in **Slack**.

This isn't just a "happy path" demo—I build with **error handling**, **retries**, and **logging** so you don't lose data if an API hiccups.

## Deliverables

1. **Workflow Map:** A clear diagram showing how data flows and transforms.
2. **n8n Workflow JSON:** The actual code/blueprint you can import into your n8n instance.
3. **Configuration Guide:** Instructions on how to swap in your own API keys and Sheet IDs.
4. **Loom Walkthrough:** A 5-minute video explaining how it works and how to maintain it.

## Tiers

### Starter ($XXX)

- **One Linear Flow:** Sheet → Notion.
- **Basic Mapping:** Up to 10 fields.
- **No AI:** Direct data transfer only.

### Standard ($XXX)

- **AI Integration:** Add GPT-4 step for summary/tagging.
- **Notifications:** Add Slack/Email alert.
- **Error Handling:** Basic retry logic.

### Advanced ($XXX)

- **Complex Logic:** Branching (e.g., "If High Priority, send to Sales; else send to Support").
- **Dashboarding:** Log stats to a separate reporting sheet.
- **30-Day Support:** I'll fix any bugs that pop up.

## Why Me?

I specialize in **AI Automation** and **Data Pipelines**. I don't just connect dots; I build systems that are observable and resilient. I've built similar workflows for lead triage, content scheduling, and customer support ticketing.
