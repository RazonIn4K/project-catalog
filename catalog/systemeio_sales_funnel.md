## The Problem

Most small businesses run a Frankenstein tech stack:
- WordPress for content
- Mailchimp for email
- Stripe for payments
- Calendly for bookings
- Spreadsheets for tracking

Leads fall through cracks. Follow-ups are manual. There's no visibility into what's actually working.

---

## The Solution

A fully integrated **Systeme.io sales funnel** that handles the complete customer journey:

```
Traffic → Capture → Segment → Nurture → Convert → Retain → Expand
         (All automated. All tracked. One platform.)
```
