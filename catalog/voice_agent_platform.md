> AI-powered voice agents that qualify leads, book appointments, and sync everything to your CRM—24/7.

## Problem
Sales and support teams lose leads to slow response times. Manual phone handling creates bottlenecks, inconsistent experiences, and zero visibility into call performance. Hiring more staff doesn't scale.

## Solution
The AI Voice Agent Platform combines **ElevenLabs neural voice synthesis** with GPT-4 conversation intelligence to handle inbound and outbound calls autonomously. Every call generates structured data that syncs to your CRM in real-time, while dashboards give you complete visibility into performance, sentiment, and conversion metrics.

## Tech Stack
- **Voice Synthesis:** ElevenLabs (preset, custom, or cloned voices)
- **Speech Recognition:** Deepgram / AssemblyAI
- **Conversation AI:** OpenAI GPT-4 with function calling
- **Telephony:** Twilio / Vonage
- **Automation:** n8n / Make.com
- **CRM:** HubSpot, Salesforce, or Airtable
- **Analytics:** Looker Studio / Metabase

## Key Capabilities

### Call Simulation & Handling
