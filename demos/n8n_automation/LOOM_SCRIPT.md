## 0:00 - Intro (Face)

"Manual data entry is killing productivity. Teams spend 3+ hours per week copying data between Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack. Here's how I automated it with AI."

## 0:15 - The Problem (Screen: Google Sheet)

"This is a typical Google Sheet with new entries. Before automation, someone had to manually copy each row, add it to Notion, and send a Slack notification. That's 3 hours per week wasted."

## 0:25 - The Workflow (Screen: n8n Canvas)

"I built an n8n workflow that monitors this sheet. When a new row appears, it automatically enriches the data with GPT-4—generating summaries, categories, and insights—then creates a Notion page and sends a formatted Slack alert."

_(Action: Show workflow nodes)_

## 0:40 - Live Demo (Screen: Trigger + Execute)

"Let me add a new entry to the sheet... Watch what happens."

_(Action: Add row, show workflow executing)_

"In 2 seconds, GPT-4 analyzed the data, created a structured Notion page with AI-generated insights, and sent a formatted Slack notification. Zero manual work."

## 0:55 - Results (Screen: Notion + Slack)

"Here's the Notion page with AI enrichment, and here's the Slack alert. This workflow processes 50 rows in 2 minutes with 99.5% accuracy. That's 156 hours saved annually."

## 1:10 - Outro (Face)

"If you're wasting time on manual data entry, I can automate it with AI. Let's talk."
