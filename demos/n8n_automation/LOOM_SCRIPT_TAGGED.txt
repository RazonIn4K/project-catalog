Manual data entry is killing productivity. Teams spend 3+ hours per week copying data between Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack. [pause] Here's how I automated it with AI.

This is a typical Google Sheet with new entries. Before automation, someone had to manually copy each row, add it to Notion, and send a Slack notification. [sighs] That's 3 hours per week wasted.

I built an n8n workflow that monitors this sheet. When a new row appears, it automatically enriches the data with GPT-4—generating summaries, categories, and insights—then creates a Notion page and sends a formatted Slack alert.

Let me add a new entry to the sheet... [pause] Watch what happens.

In 2 seconds, GPT-4 analyzed the data, created a structured Notion page with AI-generated insights, and sent a formatted Slack notification. [pause] Zero manual work.

Here's the Notion page with AI enrichment, and here's the Slack alert. This workflow processes 50 rows in 2 minutes with 99.5% accuracy. That's 156 hours saved annually.

If you're wasting time on manual data entry, I can automate it with AI. [pause] Let's talk.
