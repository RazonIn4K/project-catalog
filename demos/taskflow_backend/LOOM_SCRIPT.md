## 0:00 - Intro (Face)

"Building a SaaS? You need a backend that scales and integrates AI from Day 1. Here is 'TaskFlow Pro', a production-ready API starter kit I use for client projects."

## 0:15 - The API (Screen: Swagger UI)

"This is the auto-generated documentation. We have secure Authentication, Task Management, and most importantly, AI endpoints."

## 0:30 - The AI Feature (Screen: Postman/Swagger)

"Let's test the AI feature. I'll create a task called 'Launch Marketing Campaign'. Now, I'll hit the `ai-breakdown` endpoint."

_(Action: Execute request)_

"In less than a second, the AI suggests 5 subtasks: 'Define Audience', 'Create Ad Copy', etc. This logic is ready to be plugged into your frontend."

## 0:50 - Code Quality (Screen: VS Code)

"The code is typed, tested, and modular. It uses FastAPI and Pydantic for validation, ensuring your app is robust."

## 1:00 - Outro (Face)

"If you need a backend that's ready for the AI era, let's talk."
