## 0:00 - Intro (Face)

"Companies want AI on their internal docs, but they can't risk privacy leaks with ChatGPT. I built a secure RAG system that keeps everything private."

## 0:15 - The Problem (Screen: Google Drive)

"Employees waste hours searching Google Drive for policy documents. They need instant answers, but it has to be 100% accurate and cite sources to be trusted."

## 0:25 - The Solution (Screen: Chat Interface)

"This is a secure chatbot that only answers from your internal PDFs. Every response includes a citation with the exact page number. No data leaves your private cloud."

## 0:35 - Live Demo (Screen: Ask Question)

"Let me ask: 'What's our remote work policy?'"

_(Action: Type question, show response with citation)_

"Here's the answer, and here's the citation—direct link to page 3 of the HR policy PDF. The bot only answers from documents you provide."

## 0:50 - Security (Screen: Architecture Diagram)

"The documents are parsed, chunked, and stored in a private Vector Database. Nothing goes to public AI training sets. It's completely secure."

## 1:00 - Results (Screen: Usage Stats)

"Information retrieval time dropped from 15 minutes to under 10 seconds. Users trust it because of citations, increasing adoption by 40%."

## 1:10 - Outro (Face)

"If you need secure AI for internal knowledge, I can deploy this RAG system for your team. Let's talk."
