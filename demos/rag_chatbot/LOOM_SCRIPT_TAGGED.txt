Companies want AI on their internal docs, but they can't risk privacy leaks with ChatGPT. [pause] I built a secure RAG system that keeps everything private. Employees waste hours searching Google Drive for policy documents. [sighs] They need instant answers, but it has to be 100% accurate and cite sources to be trusted. This is a secure chatbot that only answers from your internal PDFs. Every response includes a citation with the exact page number. No data leaves your private cloud. Let me ask: 'What's our remote work policy?' [pause] Here's the answer, and here's the citation—direct link to page 3 of the HR policy PDF. The bot only answers from documents you provide. The documents are parsed, chunked, and stored in a private Vector Database. Nothing goes to public AI training sets. It's completely secure. Information retrieval time dropped from 15 minutes to under 10 seconds. Users trust it because of citations, increasing adoption by 40%. If you need secure AI for internal knowledge, I can deploy this RAG system for your team. Let's talk.
