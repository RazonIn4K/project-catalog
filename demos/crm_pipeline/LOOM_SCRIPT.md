## 0:00 - Intro (Face)

"Speed to Lead is everything. When leads wait 4 hours for follow-up, conversion rates drop 20%. I built an automated CRM pipeline that syncs leads in under 5 seconds."

## 0:15 - The Old Way (Screen: Facebook Ads Manager)

"Before automation, the client manually downloaded CSVs from Facebook Ads and uploaded them to ActiveCampaign. By the time leads were contacted, they were cold."

## 0:25 - The Solution (Screen: Make.com Scenario)

"I built a Make.com scenario that captures leads the moment they submit a form. It checks for duplicates, routes them to the right list, standardizes the data, and syncs to ActiveCampaign—all automatically."

_(Action: Show scenario flow)_

## 0:40 - Live Test (Screen: Form Submission)

"Watch this. I'll submit a test lead form..."

_(Action: Submit form, show real-time processing)_

"In 3 seconds, the lead is in ActiveCampaign with proper tags, formatted phone number, and assigned to the correct list. No manual work."

## 0:50 - Dashboard (Screen: ROI Dashboard)

"And here's the real-time dashboard showing which ad campaigns are driving revenue. The client can now see ROI per ad source instantly."

## 1:00 - Results (Screen: ActiveCampaign Contact)

"Speed to Lead went from 4 hours to under 5 seconds. Zero data entry errors. 100% accuracy. I can build this for your business in 48 hours."

## 1:10 - Outro (Face)

"Stop losing leads to slow follow-up. Let's automate your CRM pipeline today."
