[sighs] Speed to Lead is everything. When leads wait 4 hours for follow-up, conversion rates drop 20%. [pause] I built an automated CRM pipeline that syncs leads in under 5 seconds. Before automation, the client manually downloaded CSVs from Facebook Ads and uploaded them to ActiveCampaign. [sighs] By the time leads were contacted, they were cold. [clears throat] But here's the solution. I built a Make.com scenario that captures leads the moment they submit a form. It checks for duplicates, routes them to the right list, standardizes the data, and syncs to ActiveCampaign—all automatically. Watch this. I'll submit a test lead form... [pause] In 3 seconds, the lead is in ActiveCampaign with proper tags, formatted phone number, and assigned to the correct list. No manual work. [laughs] And here's the real-time dashboard showing which ad campaigns are driving revenue. The client can now see ROI per ad source instantly. Speed to Lead went from 4 hours to under 5 seconds. Zero data entry errors. 100% accuracy. I can build this for your business in 48 hours. Stop losing leads to slow follow-up. Let's automate your CRM pipeline today.
