## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Clear requirements prevented scope creep
   - Design document guided implementation
   - Tasks provided clear checklist

2. **Template Creation**
   - Upwork template is reusable for all demos
   - Saves time on future portfolio items
   - Ensures consistency

3. **Focus on Portfolio-Ready Assets**
   - Prioritized documentation over perfect implementation
   - Placeholder screenshots are acceptable
   - Can test and refine later

4. **Strategic Planning**
   - 4-day sprint plan provides clear roadmap
   - Hybrid approach (new + polish existing) is efficient
   - One demo per day is achievable

### Process Improvements

1. **Use Placeholders**
   - Don't wait for perfect screenshots
   - Diagrams and mockups work for portfolio
   - Can be replaced later

2. **Leverage Existing Work**
   - Polish existing demos faster than building new
   - Many demos just need better documentation

3. **Batch Similar Work**
   - Create all templates first
   - Then apply to multiple demos
   - More efficient than one-at-a-time
