# Bundle: B2B SaaS Revenue Ops + AI Guardrails

**Included Projects:**
- [Driver Scoring Automation](../catalog/driver_scoring.md)
- [AI Integration & Security Audit Bundle](../catalog/ai_security_bundle.md)

## Summary
Fast-moving SaaS teams get automated qualification plus a prompt-security audit in the same engagement. The result: sales leaders see cleaner pipelines while compliance has proof that AI workflows are locked down.

## Outcomes to Highlight
- Driver or partner onboarding scored and routed within two minutes.
- Narrative risk summaries + auto-created tasks keep RevOps and CS aligned.
- Prompt, webhook, and credential audits documented for legal/security review.
- Monitoring hooks (Slack + GitHub Actions) alert when configs drift.
