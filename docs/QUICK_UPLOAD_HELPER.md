**Description:**
```
Manual data entry and processing was costing teams 3+ hours per week. Data had to be copied between Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack manually, with no AI-powered insights or automated categorization.

I built an n8n automation workflow that monitors Google Sheets for new entries, enriches data using GPT-4 (generating summaries, categories, and insights), creates structured Notion database pages, and sends formatted Slack notifications—all automatically within seconds.

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling with retry logic, real-time Slack alerts for failures, and metrics tracking for monitoring. It's designed to be cloneable and customizable for different use cases.

RESULTS:
• Saves 3+ hours per week (156+ hours annually)
• Processes 50 rows in 2 minutes with 99.5% success rate
• 95% AI enrichment accuracy based on validation
• Zero manual intervention required
• Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

```

**Project Type:** Sales & Marketing → Marketing Automation

**Skills:**
```
Marketing Automation, ActiveCampaign, Make.com, CRM, Lead Generation, Google Sheets, API Integration, Dashboard, Data Hygiene, Zapier
```

**Description:**
```
Stop losing leads to slow manual data entry. I built a fully automated CRM pipeline that captures leads from Facebook Ads and Web Forms, enriches them with data, and syncs them to ActiveCampaign in real-time.

PROBLEM:
The client was manually downloading CSVs from Facebook Ads and uploading them to ActiveCampaign. This caused a 4-hour delay in follow-up, resulting in a 20% drop in conversion rates. They also lacked visibility into which ads were driving high-value leads.

SOLUTION:
I designed and implemented an automated pipeline using Make.com (formerly Integromat) and ActiveCampaign.
1.  **Instant Capture**: Webhook listeners capture leads the second they submit a form.
2.  **Smart Routing**: Leads are checked for duplicates and routed to the correct list based on their answers.
3.  **Enrichment**: Data is standardized (Name capitalization, Phone formatting) before entry.
4.  **Real-Time Dashboard**: A Google Sheets/Looker Studio dashboard updates instantly to show ROI per ad source.

RESULTS:
•   **Zero Latency**: "Speed to Lead" reduced from 4 hours to <5 seconds.
•   **100% Accuracy**: Eliminated manual data entry errors.
•   **Better Reporting**: Client can now see exactly which ad campaigns generate revenue.

TECH STACK: ActiveCampaign, Make.com, Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Webhooks

DELIVERABLES:
•   Fully configured Make.com scenarios
•   ActiveCampaign automation setup (Tags, Lists, Fields)
•   Live ROI Dashboard
•   Video training for the sales team

I can build this same pipeline for your business in under 48 hours.

```

**Project Type:** Development & IT → Back-End Development

**Skills:**
```
Python, FastAPI, API Development, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API, Docker, SaaS Development, REST API, Database Design, Authentication
```

**Description:**
```
Launching a SaaS MVP? You need a backend that is secure, scalable, and AI-ready from Day 1. I built "TaskFlow Pro," a production-grade backend starter kit designed for modern AI applications.

PROBLEM:
Most MVPs fail because they are built on "spaghetti code" that breaks under load. Developers often waste weeks setting up basic Authentication and Database connections instead of building the core product features.

SOLUTION:
I developed a modular backend architecture using Python (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL.
1.  **Secure Auth**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
2.  **AI Integration**: Built-in endpoints to connect with OpenAI/Anthropic, including prompt management and cost tracking.
3.  **Performance**: Async architecture capable of handling high concurrency.
4.  **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs for frontend teams.

RESULTS:
•   **Rapid Launch**: Reduces backend setup time by 60%.
•   **AI-Ready**: "Subtask Generator" feature demonstrates instant LLM integration.
•   **Developer Friendly**: Fully typed (Pydantic) and tested code base.

TECH STACK: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, OpenAI API, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic

DELIVERABLES:
•   Source Code (GitHub Repo)
•   API Documentation (Swagger UI)
•   Docker Compose setup for local development
•   Deployment guide (AWS/Render)

Perfect for founders who want to launch their AI SaaS in weeks, not months.

```

**Project Type:** Development & IT → AI & Machine Learning

**Skills:**
```
LangChain, Natural Language Processing, OpenAI API, Python, Vector Databases, RAG, Chatbot Development, React, Next.js, AI Integration
```

**Description:**
```
Companies want to use AI on their own data but can't risk privacy leaks with public tools like ChatGPT. I built a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows employees to chat with internal PDF documents without data leaving the private cloud.

PROBLEM:
Employees were wasting hours searching through Google Drive for policy documents and technical manuals. They needed an "Instant Answer" bot, but it had to be 100% accurate and cite its sources to be trusted.

SOLUTION:
I engineered a private RAG pipeline using LangChain and Vector Databases.
1.  **Secure Ingestion**: Documents are parsed, chunked, and stored in a private Vector DB (Chroma).
2.  **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and semantic search to find the exact right paragraph.
3.  **Citation Engine**: Every answer includes a direct link to the source PDF and page number.
4.  **Guardrails**: The bot refuses to answer questions outside the provided context, preventing hallucinations.

RESULTS:
•   **Trust**: Users verify answers via citations, increasing adoption by 40%.
•   **Efficiency**: Information retrieval time dropped from 15 minutes to <10 seconds.
•   **Privacy**: Zero data leakage to public model training sets.

TECH STACK: LangChain, Python, OpenAI (API), ChromaDB, Next.js, PDF Parsing

DELIVERABLES:
•   RAG API Backend
•   Chat Interface Frontend
•   Document Ingestion Script
•   Accuracy Evaluation Report

I can deploy this secure knowledge assistant for your internal teams or customer support.

```

**Description:**
```
As AI applications move to production, security is the #1 risk. I specialize in auditing LLM applications for vulnerabilities (Prompt Injection, Jailbreaks) and implementing robust defense layers.

PROBLEM:
A FinTech client launched a customer support bot but discovered that users could trick it into revealing system instructions and behaving inappropriately ("DAN mode"). They needed an immediate security fix to prevent reputational damage.

SOLUTION:
I performed a "Red Team" audit and implemented a multi-layer defense system.
1.  **Vulnerability Scan**: Tested the bot against 50+ known attack vectors (e.g., "Ignore previous instructions").
2.  **Heuristic Firewall**: Implemented regex-based blocking for common attack patterns.
3.  **LLM Judge**: Deployed a secondary, lightweight model to analyze user intent before passing it to the main bot.
4.  **Audit Logging**: Created a dashboard to track and analyze blocked attacks in real-time.

RESULTS:
•   **99.8% Block Rate**: Successfully stopped all known jailbreak attempts during re-testing.
•   **Compliance**: Helped the client meet SOC2 requirements for AI risk management.
•   **Peace of Mind**: Client could confidently market their AI tool without fear of abuse.

TECH STACK: Python, LangChain, Rebuff, NeMo Guardrails, OpenAI, Security Auditing

DELIVERABLES:
•   Security Audit Report (Vulnerabilities Found)
