```

**Project Type:** Sales & Marketing → Marketing Automation

**Skills:**

```
Marketing Automation, ActiveCampaign, Make.com, CRM, Lead Generation, Google Sheets, API Integration, Dashboard, Data Hygiene, Zapier
```

**Description:**

```
Stop losing leads to slow manual data entry. I built a fully automated CRM pipeline that captures leads from Facebook Ads and Web Forms, enriches them with data, and syncs them to ActiveCampaign in real-time.

PROBLEM:
The client was manually downloading CSVs from Facebook Ads and uploading them to ActiveCampaign. This caused a 4-hour delay in follow-up, resulting in a 20% drop in conversion rates. They also lacked visibility into which ads were driving high-value leads.

SOLUTION:
I designed and implemented an automated pipeline using Make.com (formerly Integromat) and ActiveCampaign.
1.  **Instant Capture**: Webhook listeners capture leads the second they submit a form.
2.  **Smart Routing**: Leads are checked for duplicates and routed to the correct list based on their answers.
3.  **Enrichment**: Data is standardized (Name capitalization, Phone formatting) before entry.
4.  **Real-Time Dashboard**: A Google Sheets/Looker Studio dashboard updates instantly to show ROI per ad source.

RESULTS:
•   **Zero Latency**: "Speed to Lead" reduced from 4 hours to <5 seconds.
•   **100% Accuracy**: Eliminated manual data entry errors.
•   **Better Reporting**: Client can now see exactly which ad campaigns generate revenue.

TECH STACK: ActiveCampaign, Make.com, Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Webhooks

DELIVERABLES:
•   Fully configured Make.com scenarios
•   ActiveCampaign automation setup (Tags, Lists, Fields)
•   Live ROI Dashboard
•   Video training for the sales team

I can build this same pipeline for your business in under 48 hours.

**Description:**

```
Launching a SaaS MVP? You need a backend that is secure, scalable, and AI-ready from Day 1. I built "TaskFlow Pro," a production-grade backend starter kit designed for modern AI applications.

PROBLEM:
Most MVPs fail because they are built on "spaghetti code" that breaks under load. Developers often waste weeks setting up basic Authentication and Database connections instead of building the core product features.

SOLUTION:
I developed a modular backend architecture using Python (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL.
1.  **Secure Auth**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
2.  **AI Integration**: Built-in endpoints to connect with OpenAI/Anthropic, including prompt management and cost tracking.
3.  **Performance**: Async architecture capable of handling high concurrency.

```

**Description:**

```
Companies want to use AI on their own data but can't risk privacy leaks with public tools like ChatGPT. I built a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows employees to chat with internal PDF documents without data leaving the private cloud.

PROBLEM:
Employees were wasting hours searching through Google Drive for policy documents and technical manuals. They needed an "Instant Answer" bot, but it had to be 100% accurate and cite its sources to be trusted.

SOLUTION:
I engineered a private RAG pipeline using LangChain and Vector Databases.
1.  **Secure Ingestion**: Documents are parsed, chunked, and stored in a private Vector DB (Chroma).
2.  **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and semantic search to find the exact right paragraph.
3.  **Citation Engine**: Every answer includes a direct link to the source PDF and page number.
4.  **Guardrails**: The bot refuses to answer questions outside the provided context, preventing hallucinations.

RESULTS:
•   **Trust**: Users verify answers via citations, increasing adoption by 40%.
•   **Efficiency**: Information retrieval time dropped from 15 minutes to <10 seconds.
•   **Privacy**: Zero data leakage to public model training sets.

TECH STACK: LangChain, Python, OpenAI (API), ChromaDB, Next.js, PDF Parsing

**Description:**

```
As AI applications move to production, security is the #1 risk. I specialize in auditing LLM applications for vulnerabilities (Prompt Injection, Jailbreaks) and implementing robust defense layers.

PROBLEM:
A FinTech client launched a customer support bot but discovered that users could trick it into revealing system instructions and behaving inappropriately ("DAN mode"). They needed an immediate security fix to prevent reputational damage.

SOLUTION:
I performed a "Red Team" audit and implemented a multi-layer defense system.
1.  **Vulnerability Scan**: Tested the bot against 50+ known attack vectors (e.g., "Ignore previous instructions").
2.  **Heuristic Firewall**: Implemented regex-based blocking for common attack patterns.
3.  **LLM Judge**: Deployed a secondary, lightweight model to analyze user intent before passing it to the main bot.
4.  **Audit Logging**: Created a dashboard to track and analyze blocked attacks in real-time.

RESULTS:
•   **99.8% Block Rate**: Successfully stopped all known jailbreak attempts during re-testing.
•   **Compliance**: Helped the client meet SOC2 requirements for AI risk management.

Scaling an education business requires more than just ads—it needs a system that nurtures leads 24/7. I architected a complete Instagram DM automation funnel for an IT Training program that converts comments into enrolled students.

PROBLEM:
The client was overwhelmed by DMs asking "price?" and "details?", spending 4+ hours/day manually replying. Response times were slow, and leads were slipping through the cracks.

SOLUTION:
I built a comprehensive ManyChat automation system:
1.  **Comment Growth Tool**: Automatically DMs users who comment "INFO" on posts.
2.  **Segmentation**: Qualifies leads (Beginner vs. Career Changer) to send relevant content.
3.  **7-Day Nurture**: Delivers value (guides, success stories) to build trust before selling.

**Description:**

```
Scaling an agency is hard when you're bottlenecked by manual coding and design. I built "Agency OS," a unified operating system that orchestrates Google's latest AI agents to automate the entire delivery pipeline.

PROBLEM:
Client projects were stalling because switching between "Designer Mode" and "Developer Mode" caused context switching fatigue. I needed a way to delegate specific roles to AI agents while I acted as the Architect.

SOLUTION:
I architected a multi-agent system using Google's experimental tools:
1.  **Google Stitch (The Designer)**: Generates UI components and dashboards based on natural language specs.
2.  **Google Jules (The Engineer)**: Autonomous coding agent that writes backend logic and connects APIs.
3.  **Mock Backend (The Sandbox)**: A safe simulation environment for agents to test code before production.
