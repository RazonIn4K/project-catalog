## 🎬 Recording Tips

### Technical
1. **Resolution:** Record in 1080p minimum
2. **Frame Rate:** 30fps is fine
3. **Audio:** Use the generated MP3 files (don't record voice)
4. **Screen:** Full screen or window capture
5. **Cursor:** Keep cursor visible, move smoothly

### Performance
1. **Practice once:** Run through script once before recording
2. **Natural pace:** Don't rush, follow the script timing
3. **Pauses:** Use natural pauses, not robotic
4. **Energy:** Keep energy up, but be conversational
5. **Errors:** If you make a mistake, pause and restart that section

### Editing
1. **Trim:** Cut dead air at start/end
2. **Sync:** Ensure audio matches video timing
3. **Transitions:** Simple cuts are fine
4. **Text overlays:** Optional, but can add key metrics
5. **Thumbnail:** Create eye-catching thumbnail

## 📦 Post-Production Workflow

### For Each Video
1. **Import audio** (`*_demo_audio.mp3`)
2. **Import screen recording**
3. **Sync audio to video** (match timing)
