# 90-Day Bootcamp Funnel Revamp: From Scattered Assets to Enrollment Machine

> How we unified a fragmented marketing stack and increased course enrollments by 147% without creating a single new piece of content.

---

## The Client

A mid-sized IT bootcamp running CompTIA, AWS, and cybersecurity certification programs. They'd been operating for 3 years with decent word-of-mouth but couldn't scale past ~40 enrollments per month.

**Their problem wasn't a lack of assets.** They had *too many*—scattered across platforms that didn't talk to each other.

---

## The Problem: Death by a Thousand Disconnects

When we audited their stack, we found:

| Asset | Platform | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 47 Instagram posts with 10K+ reach | IG | No capture mechanism |
| 12 YouTube tutorials (82K total views) | YouTube | Links to dead landing page |
| 3 lead magnets (salary guide, roadmap, checklist) | Mailchimp | No follow-up sequence |
| 6 recorded webinars | Vimeo | Password-protected, unused |
| 2,300 email subscribers | Mailchimp | Last email sent 4 months ago |
| Facebook group (1,800 members) | FB | No funnel integration |

**The diagnosis:**
- Leads were coming in from organic content but hitting dead ends
- No automated follow-up—every lead required manual DM or email
- Webinar recordings were *gold* but buried behind friction
- Email list was going cold because nobody had time to write sequences
- Zero visibility into what was actually converting

The founder was spending 15+ hours/week manually DMing prospects and still losing leads to competitors with better follow-up.

## The Solution: Stitch, Automate, Measure

We didn't build new content. We connected what already existed.

### Phase 1: Unified Capture Layer (Weeks 1-3)

**The Fix:**
- Deployed ManyChat across Instagram and Facebook
- Created comment triggers on top-performing posts (keywords: "FREE", "INFO", "LINK")
- Built a single welcome flow that captured email + certification interest
- Connected to existing Mailchimp list with proper tagging

**The Result:**
The same organic posts that were generating likes started generating leads. Comment-to-contact conversion hit 52%.

### Phase 2: Automated Nurture Engine (Weeks 4-6)

**The Problem:**
Their 3 lead magnets were just... sitting there. A prospect would download the salary guide and never hear from anyone again.

**The Fix:**
- Created a 7-part DM nurture sequence using their *existing* content:
  - Day 1: "Here's your guide" + quick win tip
  - Day 3: YouTube tutorial link (repurposed)
  - Day 5: Success story from Facebook group
  - Day 7: Webinar invite (their old recordings, now unlocked)
  - Day 10: Soft pitch + calendar link
  - Day 14: Objection handler (FAQ-based)
  - Day 21: Last chance + social proof

- Set up abandoned flow recovery—if someone stopped engaging, they got a "Did we lose you?" re-engagement message

**The Result:**
Nurture sequence completion rate: 34%. Webinar registration rate from DM: 28%.

---

### Phase 3: Conversion & Tracking (Weeks 7-10)

**The Fix:**
- Post-webinar follow-up sequence (3 touches over 5 days)
- Payment integration with Stripe for instant checkout
- Lead scoring system to flag "hot" prospects (quiz completed + webinar watched = priority)
- Built a live dashboard tracking: Leads → Registrations → Attendance → Enrollments

**Before:**
- No idea which content drove enrollments
- Sales calls booked manually via back-and-forth DMs
- Conversion guesswork

**After:**
- Attribution from first touch to payment
- Automated calendar booking for strategy calls
- Real-time funnel visibility

---

### Phase 4: Re-Activation Campaign (Weeks 11-12)

**The Opportunity:**
That dormant 2,300-subscriber email list? We didn't ignore it.

**The Fix:**
- Designed a 5-email re-engagement campaign:
  1. "We've been quiet, here's why" (transparency play)
  2. New free resource (repurposed webinar clip)
  3. Success story spotlight
  4. Limited-time enrollment bonus
  5. Final call

**The Result:**
- 41% open rate on email 1 (cold list benchmark: 15-20%)
- 127 subscribers clicked through to the new funnel
- 23 enrollments from "dead" leads alone

| Metric | Before | After | Change |

| Lead capture rate | ~5% | 52% | **+10x** |
| Email list engagement | 8% open rate | 38% open rate | **+375%** |
| Manual DM hours/week | 15+ | 2 | **-87%** |
| Webinar registration rate | 12% | 28% | **+133%** |
| Time to first response | 4-24 hours | Instant | **Automated** |
| Cost of new content created | — | $0 | **Existing assets only** |

## Why This Worked

### 1. Existing Content Was Already Validated
Their YouTube videos had views. Their posts had engagement. The audience had already voted on what resonated—we just built pipes to capture the interest.

### 2. Automation Eliminated the Bottleneck
The founder was the bottleneck. Every lead waited for *him* to respond. By automating the first 80% of the conversation, he could focus on closing warm prospects instead of chasing cold ones.

### 3. The Funnel Created Visibility
Before: "I think Instagram works better than Facebook, but I'm not sure."
After: "Instagram drives 3.2x more enrollments per lead than Facebook. Here's the data."

### 4. Speed Wins
The old process: Prospect comments → Maybe sees it tomorrow → Manual DM → Back and forth → Maybe books a call
The new process: Prospect comments → Instant DM → Automated nurture → Self-service booking → Done

## Key Takeaways

1. **Audit before you build.** Most businesses are sitting on underutilized assets. Find them first.

2. **Connect, don't create.** The fastest ROI comes from connecting existing content into a coherent journey—not producing more content that sits unused.

3. **Automation isn't about removing humans.** It's about removing *delay*. The founder still closes deals—he just doesn't waste time on unqualified leads.

4. **Measure the whole funnel.** "Engagement" means nothing if you can't trace it to revenue.
