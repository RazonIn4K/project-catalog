## Title

Automated CRM Pipeline: Instant Lead Sync & Enrichment (ActiveCampaign)

---

## Description

```
Stop losing leads to slow manual data entry. I built a fully automated CRM pipeline that captures leads from Facebook Ads and Web Forms, enriches them with data, and syncs them to ActiveCampaign in real-time.

PROBLEM:
The client was manually downloading CSVs from Facebook Ads and uploading them to ActiveCampaign. This caused a 4-hour delay in follow-up, resulting in a 20% drop in conversion rates. They also lacked visibility into which ads were driving high-value leads.

SOLUTION:
I designed and implemented an automated pipeline using Make.com (formerly Integromat) and ActiveCampaign.
1.  **Instant Capture**: Webhook listeners capture leads the second they submit a form.
2.  **Smart Routing**: Leads are checked for duplicates and routed to the correct list based on their answers.
3.  **Enrichment**: Data is standardized (Name capitalization, Phone formatting) before entry.
4.  **Real-Time Dashboard**: A Google Sheets/Looker Studio dashboard updates instantly to show ROI per ad source.

RESULTS:
•   **Zero Latency**: "Speed to Lead" reduced from 4 hours to <5 seconds.
•   **100% Accuracy**: Eliminated manual data entry errors.
•   **Better Reporting**: Client can now see exactly which ad campaigns generate revenue.

TECH STACK: ActiveCampaign, Make.com, Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Webhooks

DELIVERABLES:
•   Fully configured Make.com scenarios
•   ActiveCampaign automation setup (Tags, Lists, Fields)
•   Live ROI Dashboard
•   Video training for the sales team

I can build this same pipeline for your business in under 48 hours.
