## Title

Enterprise RAG Chatbot: Secure AI for Internal Docs (LangChain)

---

## Description

```
Companies want to use AI on their own data but can't risk privacy leaks with public tools like ChatGPT. I built a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows employees to chat with internal PDF documents without data leaving the private cloud.

PROBLEM:
Employees were wasting hours searching through Google Drive for policy documents and technical manuals. They needed an "Instant Answer" bot, but it had to be 100% accurate and cite its sources to be trusted.

SOLUTION:
I engineered a private RAG pipeline using LangChain and Vector Databases.
1.  **Secure Ingestion**: Documents are parsed, chunked, and stored in a private Vector DB (Chroma).
2.  **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and semantic search to find the exact right paragraph.
3.  **Citation Engine**: Every answer includes a direct link to the source PDF and page number.
4.  **Guardrails**: The bot refuses to answer questions outside the provided context, preventing hallucinations.

RESULTS:
•   **Trust**: Users verify answers via citations, increasing adoption by 40%.
•   **Efficiency**: Information retrieval time dropped from 15 minutes to <10 seconds.
•   **Privacy**: Zero data leakage to public model training sets.

TECH STACK: LangChain, Python, OpenAI (API), ChromaDB, Next.js, PDF Parsing

DELIVERABLES:
•   RAG API Backend
•   Chat Interface Frontend
•   Document Ingestion Script
•   Accuracy Evaluation Report

I can deploy this secure knowledge assistant for your internal teams or customer support.
