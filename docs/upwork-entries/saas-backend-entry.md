## Title

Scalable SaaS Backend with AI Features (FastAPI + OpenAI)

---

## Description

```
Launching a SaaS MVP? You need a backend that is secure, scalable, and AI-ready from Day 1. I built "TaskFlow Pro," a production-grade backend starter kit designed for modern AI applications.

PROBLEM:
Most MVPs fail because they are built on "spaghetti code" that breaks under load. Developers often waste weeks setting up basic Authentication and Database connections instead of building the core product features.

SOLUTION:
I developed a modular backend architecture using Python (FastAPI) and PostgreSQL.
1.  **Secure Auth**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.
2.  **AI Integration**: Built-in endpoints to connect with OpenAI/Anthropic, including prompt management and cost tracking.
3.  **Performance**: Async architecture capable of handling high concurrency.
4.  **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI docs for frontend teams.

RESULTS:
•   **Rapid Launch**: Reduces backend setup time by 60%.
•   **AI-Ready**: "Subtask Generator" feature demonstrates instant LLM integration.
•   **Developer Friendly**: Fully typed (Pydantic) and tested code base.

TECH STACK: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, OpenAI API, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic

DELIVERABLES:
•   Source Code (GitHub Repo)
•   API Documentation (Swagger UI)
•   Docker Compose setup for local development
•   Deployment guide (AWS/Render)

Perfect for founders who want to launch their AI SaaS in weeks, not months.
