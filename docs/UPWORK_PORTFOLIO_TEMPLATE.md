### 2. Project Description

**Format**: Problem → Solution → Results (300-500 words)

**Template**:

```
[PROBLEM - 2-3 sentences]
Describe the pain point or challenge. Be specific about what was broken, slow, or manual.

[SOLUTION - 3-4 sentences]
Explain what you built and how it works. Mention key technologies and integrations.

[RESULTS - 3-4 bullet points]
• Specific metric (time saved, accuracy, speed)
• Business impact (revenue, efficiency, quality)
• Technical achievement (integrations, scale, reliability)

[TECH STACK]
List all technologies used: n8n, GPT-4, Notion, Slack, etc.

[DELIVERABLES]
• Working workflow/code
• Documentation and setup guide
• Training materials
• Ongoing support (if applicable)
```

**Example**:

```
Manual data entry and processing was costing teams 3+ hours per week. Data had to be copied between Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack manually, with no AI-powered insights or automated categorization.

I built an n8n automation workflow that monitors Google Sheets for new entries, enriches data using GPT-4 (generating summaries, categories, and insights), creates structured Notion database pages, and sends formatted Slack notifications—all automatically within seconds.

RESULTS:
• Saves 3+ hours per week (156+ hours annually)
• Processes 50 rows in 2 minutes with 99.5% success rate
• 95% AI enrichment accuracy based on validation
• Zero manual intervention required

TECH STACK: n8n, Google Sheets API, OpenAI GPT-4, Notion API, Slack Webhooks, JavaScript

DELIVERABLES:
• Complete n8n workflow (importable JSON)
• Comprehensive setup guide (15-minute deployment)
• Sample data templates
• Error handling and monitoring
• Loom video walkthrough
```

## Complete Example: n8n Automation Demo

### Title
n8n Automation: AI-Powered Data Processing That Saves 3+ Hours/Week

### Description
Manual data entry and processing was costing teams 3+ hours per week. Data had to be copied between Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack manually, with no AI-powered insights or automated categorization.

I built an n8n automation workflow that monitors Google Sheets for new entries, enriches data using GPT-4 (generating summaries, categories, and insights), creates structured Notion database pages, and sends formatted Slack notifications—all automatically within seconds.

The workflow includes comprehensive error handling with retry logic, real-time Slack alerts for failures, and metrics tracking for monitoring. It's designed to be cloneable and customizable for different use cases.

RESULTS:
• Saves 3+ hours per week (156+ hours annually)
• Processes 50 rows in 2 minutes with 99.5% success rate
• 95% AI enrichment accuracy based on validation
• Zero manual intervention required
• Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

TECH STACK: n8n, Google Sheets API, OpenAI GPT-4, Notion API, Slack Webhooks, JavaScript

DELIVERABLES:
• Complete n8n workflow (importable JSON)
• Comprehensive setup guide (15-minute deployment)
• Sample data templates and examples
• Error handling and monitoring setup
• Loom video walkthrough (3 minutes)
• Full documentation and troubleshooting guide

This pattern can be adapted for lead management, content pipelines, support tickets, data analysis, and any manual workflow that needs AI enhancement and multi-tool integration.
